# Implementing and Developing SQL Server Objects

## Course Description
This comprehensive course equips learners with the knowledge and hands-on skills needed to create, manage, and optimize SQL Server objects and related technologies. You will cover everything from database creation and integrity controls to advanced reporting and high-availability solutions. Each module emphasizes practice through demonstrations, assignments, and quizzes so that every concept is reinforced by real-world execution. By the end, you will understand SQL Server capabilities and best practices, ready to tackle production-grade database development challenges.

## What You Will Learn
- Create and manage databases using wizards and scripts.
- Apply database integrity rules, constraints, and default values.
- Implement indexing strategies, backup plans, and database snapshots.
- Demonstrate daily database management tasks in practical scenarios.
- Work with variables, control-of-flow logic, and reusable functions.
- Use scripting, batching, and transaction management techniques.
- Apply SQL programming skills in iterative, hands-on assignments.
- Query advanced structures via views, XML, and hierarchical data.
- Implement CTEs, sequences, mirroring, and log shipping for HA.
- Apply advanced database features inside realistic case studies.
- Create stored procedures, triggers, and CLR-based custom functions.
- Differentiate procedures and functions to choose the right approach.
- Automate workflows using SQL Server Management Objects (SMO).
- Reinforce concepts through graded assignments and demonstrations.
- Develop dynamic reports with SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS).
- Understand warehousing fundamentals, OLAP vs. OLTP, and dimensional modeling.
- Demonstrate reporting and warehousing skills in guided projects.
- Design and implement an end-to-end database solution that integrates all course concepts.

## Requirements
- Completion of the **Transact SQL Queries using SQL Server** course (or equivalent experience).
- SQL Server 2019 or later plus SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or Azure Data Studio.
- Access to the sample backups located at the repository root (`AdventureWorks2012.bak`, `Company DB.bak`, `ITI DB.bak`).
